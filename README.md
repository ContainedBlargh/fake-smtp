# fake-smtp
A handy little nodejs script for faking an smtp server for testing purposes.

It receives emails, timestamps them and saves them to the working directory as `.eml` files.

Defaults to opening port 456 for no particular reason, if you want it to listen on a different port, you need to alter the code.

This could probably have been a github gist instead, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
